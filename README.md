# CustomFX

The Custom FX library is a library created for Arduino based microcontrollers. The library is used to create interactive applications for LEDs, LED strips, etc. using various input signals. The library contains building blocks that enables you to create applications quickly. The event driven mechanism makes it easy to act on changing input signals coming from buttons, sensors and timers. The animation framework lets you create LED effects very quickly.

Install the Custom FX library in the Arduino Libraries folder. Restart the Arduino IDE after installing the library and open one of the examples in `File --> Examples --> Custom FX` to get started.
